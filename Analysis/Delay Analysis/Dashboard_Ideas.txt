Description

Take the average flight delay of each airline for each year, including all flights (even with no delays) in the average calculation. Departure delays that have NULL as a value have been replaced with 0 for this calculation. This is only for flights that are not cancelled. Only flights that are not cancelled are used for this calculation.

Dashboard

The average flight delay for each year can be displayed on a bar chart for any airline, or in general (all airlines).
Explore options for combinations of airlines in one bar plot.
