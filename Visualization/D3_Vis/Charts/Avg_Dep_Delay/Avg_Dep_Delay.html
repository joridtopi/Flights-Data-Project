		<b>Average Departure Delay</b>
		<br><br>The average departure delay is calculated by averaging the total delay minutes of every departed flight over the amount of flights for a certain period of time, either yearly or daily. The average departure delay is also grouped by air carrier, so that the performance of each air carrier can be observed and compared.
