		<b>Number of Aircraft Used</b>
		<br><br>This is a statistic on the total number of aircraft flown. The number of aircraft is aggregated by year, and by day. In addition to the overall picture of domestic flights, the visualizations are grouped by airline where the user can compare the statistic of multiple airlines. The number of aircraft is obtained by the distinct tail numbers from the BTS data.
		The tail numbers are not available for the following years: 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 2001, 2002.
