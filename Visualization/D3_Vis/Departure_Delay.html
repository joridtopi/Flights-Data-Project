		<br><br><u>Average Departure Delay</u> -
		<br><br>The average departure delay is calculated by averaging the total delay minutes of every departed (not cancelled) flight over the amount of flights for a certain period of time, either yearly or daily. The average departure delay is also grouped by air carrier, so that the performance of each air carrier can be observed.
